## About

Everyone's making pixel consistent textures these days, but what about *ALL* the textures?

### What's NEW?

The latest release üîß fixed a bunch of texture and model issues, added support for rabbit and baby rabbit üêá, and a whole bunch of new armor trim textures too! ü§∫

To go along with the armor trim theme, I've also created a new resource pack, called [Armor Trim Consistency](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/armor-trim-consistency)

To see the rest, check out the [changelog](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pixel-consistency/changelog), or for everything, the [wiki](https://github.com/Thanos1716/pixel-consistency/wiki/features).

### What is this?

For years, Minecraft's lack of respect for uniform pixel sizes has bothered me, I'm glad that Mojang are finally starting to acknowledge this with the addition of new models for the vex and bat, but they nowhere near cover everything that's inconsistent, so I've designed and tested hundreds of new models that fix exactly that!

The goal of this resource pack is to make all textures in Minecraft have consistently sized pixels in-game.
In my opinion, this significantly improves the look and feel of Minecraft, giving it a more coherent visual style.

This project is currently in beta development at roughly **60% complete**, and most of the commonly observed inconsistencies have been fixed.

### How do I get it to work?

The vast majority of the features in this pack (including anything entity related) require <strong>client mods</strong>, so whilst a few will work in vanilla, most features will only work if you have one of the following installed:
 - [Fabulously Optimized](https://download.fo) (recommended)
 - [ETF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) and [EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) (manual installation)
 - Any modpack including the above mods on Fabric or Forge

If installing manually, you can also optionally include [Animatica](https://modrinth.com/mod/animatica) for some animated textures. ([unofficial Forge port](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/animaticareforged))

<strong>If you use this resource pack with OptiFine, please be aware that <ins>not all features will work, and things will be broken</ins> as I do not provide support for it directly.</strong>

<!-- Either the [Modrinth Launcher](https://modrinth.com/app) or [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/) are recommended. -->

## Features

This resource pack currently supports over **100 new entity models** for consistent babies, signs, banners, minecart blocks, spawner entities, and all sorts of other entities, as well as a collection of fixes to blocks, particles and GUIs too! For a full list of features, be sure to check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Thanos1716/pixel-consistency/wiki/features)

There may be issues, and not all pixel inconsistencies can be, or have been fixed yet, but I'm always working to expand the list of possible fixes

This resource pack may also include support for mods. Currently supported mods can be found [here](https://github.com/Thanos1716/pixel-consistency/wiki/mod-support), and if you would like me to support a mod, feel free to raise an issue or ask in the Discord server.

<!--
Textures and models that are already pixel consistent in vanilla Minecraft are not listed.
Some models found in this resource pack aren't fully pixel consistent, due to the Z-fighting issues that can occur when rendering two textures directly over the top of each other. In future there may be an option to use fully pixel consistent models, however at present they are not included because they don't look great.-->

A quick taster of some of what this pack includes:

More images can be found in the gallery!

<!-- This project has taken too many hours, but I'm happy with how it's coming along. -->

### Fresh Animations Support?

Fresh Animations is not yet supported because of the drastic remodel of most edited mobs, however I am planning on adding support for it soon. This will likely take the form of a separate resourcepack.

### Curseforge

I will not be hosting this pack on Curseforge due to:
 - No Linux support for Minecraft in the Curseforge launcher (despite both Minecraft and Curseforge having a Linux client)
 - No option to create an account without linking other services
 - The general state that Curseforge is in.

<strong>Due to the reasons outlined above and although the license permits it, I would appreciate it if you don't upload direct copies of this pack to Curseforge.</strong> Any derivatives of it however, go wild!

## Licensing

This project is licensed under the permissive Creative Commons Zero 1.0 license in order to bring pixel consistency to as many people as possible, that means you can use any model in this pack however you like, you don't even have to give me credit, although that's always appreciated.

Note that the license CC0-1.0 applies to all of the models and most of the textures used in this pack. Some textures in this pack are modified versions of the vanilla assets, which are required to make the pack work, however no direct copies of assets under Mojang copyright are included.

## Credit

Thanks to Traben for developing both ETF and EMF, and for being very helpful when asking questions about CEM.

This resource pack is partially inspired by [Better Vanilla Babies & Pixel Perfect Mobs](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/better-vanilla-babies-optifine-1-14-4/) by DraminOver. No assets from that pack are used in this one.

If you are a resource pack developer and enjoy my work, I would love if you included any of my textures or models from this pack in yours. Any credit is appreciated!

If you would like to upload a video showcasing this resource pack to a third party platform like Youtube or Odysee, credit would be highly appreciated, and be sure to let me know, I might include it here!
