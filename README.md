## About

### What is this?

The goal of this resourcepack is to make all textures in Minecraft have consistently sized pixels in-game.
In my opinion, this significantly improves the look and feel of Minecraft as a whole, and lends itself to a more coherent visual style.

An example of the baby turtle differences is shown below:

This project is currently in beta development at roughly 40% complete, but the majority of commonly observed inconsistencies have been fixed.

There may be issues, and not all pixel inconsistencies can be, or have been fixed yet.

### How do I get it to work?

This resourcepack is designed to work with [Fabulously Optimized](https://download.fo), an Optifine backwards-compatible Fabric based modpack with better support, more frequent updates, and more open development.

The vast majority of the features in this pack require <strong>client mods</strong>, so whilst a few will work in vanilla, most features will only work if you have one of the following installed:
 - [Fabulously Optimized](https://download.fo) (recommended)
 - [Entity Texture Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) & [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) (manual installation)
 - Any modpack including ETF & EMF on Fabric or Forge
 - [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) (not recommended)

<strong>If you use this resourcepack with Optifine, please be aware that <ins>not all features will work</ins>, and I do not provide support for it directly.</strong>

<!-- Either the [Modrinth Launcher](https://modrinth.com/app) or [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/) are recommended. -->

## Features

A complete list of the features found in this pack can be found [here](https://github.com/Thanos1716/pixel-consistency/wiki/features.md)
Textures and models that are already pixel consistent in vanilla Minecraft are not listed.

Some models found in this resourcepack aren't fully pixel consistent, due to the Z-fighting issues that can occur when rendering two textures directly over the top of each other. In future there may be an option to use fully pixel consistent models, however at present they are not included because they don't look great.

For years, Minecraft's lack of respect for uniform pixel sizes has bothered me, I'm glad that Mojang are finally starting to acknowledge this with the addition of new models for the vex and bat, but they nowhere near cover everything that's inconsistent, so here I have made a list of everything that isn't and am doing my best to fix them one by one.

This project has taken too many hours, but I'm happy with how it's coming along.

<!-- The anvil hammer texture had? a double column of pixels? -->

### Fresh Animations Support?

Fresh animations is not yet supported because of the drastic remodel of most edited mobs, however I am planning on adding support for it soon. This will likely take the form of a separate resourcepack.

## Links

This project is being hosted on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pixel-consistency) and it's source can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Thanos1716/pixel-consistency).

If you have:

 - Discovered an inconsistent texture or model that is not listed,
 - Found a broken texture or model in this pack, or
 - Would like to request a feature

please raise an issue on the [issues](https://github.com/Thanos1716/pixel-consistency/issues) page.

### Curseforge

I will not be hosting this pack on Curseforge due to a combination of no Linux support for Minecraft in the Curseforge launcher (despite both Minecraft and Curseforge having a Linux client), no option to create an account without linking other services, and the general state that Curseforge is in.

<strong>Due to the reasons outlined above and although the license permits it, I would appreciate it if you don't upload direct copies of this pack to Curseforge.</strong> Any derivatives of it however, go wild!

## Licensing

This project is licensed under the permissive Creative Commons Zero 1.0 license in order to bring pixel consistency to as many people as possible, that means you can use any model in this pack however you like, you don't even have to give me credit, although that's always appreciated.

Note that the license CC0-1.0 applies to all of the models and most of the textures used in this pack. Some textures in this pack are modified versions of the vanilla assets, which are required to make the pack work, however no direct copies of assets under Mojang copyright are included. If you wish to use all of the CC0-1.0 assets without dealing with Mojang's assets, they can be found [here](https://github.com/Thanos1716/pixel-consistency/tree/main/source/cc0-assets/).

## Credit

Thanks to Traben for developing both ETF and EMF, and for being very helpful when asking questions about CEM.

This resourcepack is partially inspired by [Better Vanilla Babies & Pixel Perfect Mobs](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/better-vanilla-babies-optifine-1-14-4/) by DraminOver. No assets from that pack are used in this one.

## Support Me

The best way to support me at the moment is by downloading and following my resourcepack!

I don't have any donation options available, but that is something I may consider setting up in the future. If this is something you would like, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/Thanos1716/pixel-consistency/issues).

If you are a resourcepack developer and enjoy my work, I would love it if you included any models from this pack in yours!
